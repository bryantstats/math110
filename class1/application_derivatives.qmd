We can use the derivatives to find the minimum and maximum of functions.  Suppose we want to find the minimum and maximum of a function $f(x)$. In these examples, the procedure to do is as follows. 

- Step 1: Find and simplify $f'(x)$

- Step 2: Solve $f'(x) = 0$. Suppose that the solution is $x=c$. 

- Step 3: Calculate $f''(x)$ and evaluate $f''(c)$.

  - If $f''(c) < 0$, $f(x)$ is maximized at  $x=c$.
  - If $f''(c) >0$, $f(x)$ is minimized at $x = c.$
